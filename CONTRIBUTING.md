## Setting up RedWarn

RedWarn is built through [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), a module bundler that allows us to easily build frontend code. Aside from that, RedWarn uses [tsx-dom](https://github.com/Lusito/tsx-dom) in order to build the interface. Contrary to React, tsx-dom generates usable HTMLElements directly from JSX. This keeps our total file size low and build times even lower. Aside from that, we can modify the DOM with JSX like we would normally do if we were using `document.createElement`.

### For production

1. Install the required dependencies with `npm`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Bundle everything with `webpack` using the `build` task.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3. The built copy of RedWarn will be in `/build`. You can then put this on Wikipedia as a userscript like how we distribute RedWarn, or put it on a locally-hosted web server and import it from there.
