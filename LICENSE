RedWarn License Declaration

This file itself is not a license, but an informative description of RedWarn's
copyright and license status, and consequently the copyright and license status of
any code that you contribute.

PREAMBLE

    RedWarn is a fully free (as in free beer) open-source project developed by many people,
    however unlike most open-source projects because of RedWarn's use on Wikimedia and
    other projects, we don't simply have one license in all cases.

LICENSES

    RedWarn is de-facto licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
    The terms of this license is available in the file named `LICENSE.APACHE`.
    If you did not receive a copy of this file, it is available at:

        https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt

    For releases compiled and localised for Wikimedia and other authorised Wikis ONLY:

    To comply with the copyright of Wikimedia Foundation and other autorised wikis,
    we are also required to license the _transpiled files_ (i.e. "built" versions of
    RedWarn) that have been released on-Wiki by us under the Creative Commons
    Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License and the GNU Free Documentation License.
    The terms of these are available at:

        https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode.txt
        https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.txt

    Critically, the source files are not inherently available under the CC BY-SA 3.0 and
    GFDL license, and never will be. The licensors will not provide raw source files under
    any other licenses, commercial or non-commercial, except under the Apache License 2.0.

AUTHORISED WIKIS

    The list of Wikis that have Apache-incompatible licenses that are currently
    authorised to host RedWarn are as follows:
    - all Wikimedia projects

    Not every Wiki that supports CC BY-SA 3.0 can host RedWarn on-wiki without
    authorisation from the licensors. For more information regarding licensing,
    email ed6767wiki (!at!) gmail dot com.

SOLE LICENSOR

    Only the RedWarn Team can license other RedWarn builds. By contributing to
    the RedWarn respository or any forks of it, you allow the RedWarn Team to
    license your code on your behalf.

BASICALLY, WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO

    You can:
    - use or modify the code and any transpiled versions under the conditions
      of the Apache License 2.0
    - use or modify the transpiled versions that are released on-Wiki under the
      Apache License 2.0
    - release or host RedWarn, or any modifications of it on your Wiki without
      authorisation, if the license under which the code will be hosted is
      compatible with the Apache License 2.0

    You can't:
    - build or transpile RedWarn yourself from source and release it on Wikis
      that do not support the Apache License 2.0 without express permission from
      the licensors.
    - release versions of RedWarn yourself that are built from source on
      Apache-incompatible Wiki's that haven't been released by the RedWarn Team.
      Remember: only the RedWarn Team can license and release transpilled
      versions of RedWarn under CC BY SA and GFDL.

REASONING

    It may seem like a gigantic copyright mess to license the transpiled files
    under the terms of all three licenses, however this is done to best avoid
    potential violations of the terms of ANY of the licenses above. Since
    Wikipedia requires text content to be released under CC BY-SA 3.0 and the
    GFDL, RedWarn's transpiled output files may not be published unless released
    under the terms of those licenses. Wikipedia requires this double-license
    format since 2009, and is a way to allow text to be used in a
    less-restrictive manner since the GFDL is too restrictive with text content.

    Since RedWarn consists of code and not documentation, it's best to license
    it under a code-focused license such as the Apache License 2.0. The Apache
    License allows for sublicensing, which can allow us to release the code as
    both under the Apache license and the GFDL and CC BY-SA 3.0 tandem that
    Wikipedia uses.

KEEP OTHER LIBARIES SEPERATE

    For code and libaries that can't be released under CC BY-SA 3.0 or GFDL,
    and don't support sub-licensing, these must be kept seperate and included via a CDN.

SUMMARY

    In summary, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS REPOSITORY MUST BE LICENSED UNDER
    THE Apache License 2.0. Transpiled versions of the code made available by
    the RedWarn Team on Wikimedia Foundation and other authorised wikis are also
    licensed under the GFDL and CC BY-SA 3.0 licenses.
    
    By contibuting, you let us license your code on your behalf to make this
    possible.


DISCLAIMER

    RedWarn, as determined by its licenses, is provided on an "as is" basis
    without any warranties or conditions of any kind.
