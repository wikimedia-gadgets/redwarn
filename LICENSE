RedWarn License Declaration

This file itself is not a license, but an informative description of RedWarn's
copyright status.

PREAMBLE

    RedWarn is, and always will be, an open-source project, made
    entirely by volunteers. Since RedWarn is used on openly-sourced
    projects, we need to provide RedWarn under the proper licenses
    to make it usable but still retain proper attribution for our work.

    This repository's contents is available under the following licenses,
    unless otherwise explicitly stated by an additional LICENSE file in
    the directory of the included content.

LICENSES

    RedWarn is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. The terms of this
    license is available in the file named `LICENSE.APACHE`. If you did
    not receive a copy of this file, it is available on the Internet under
    the following URL.

        https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt

    To comply with the copyright of Wikimedia Foundation wikis, we are also
    required to license the _transpiled files_ under the Creative Commons
    Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License and the GNU Free Documentation
    License. The terms of these are available on the Internet
    under the following URLs, respectively.

        https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode.txt
        https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.txt

    The source files are not inherently available under the CC BY-SA 3.0 and
    GFDL license, but you may sublicense them given any potential contributions.

REASONING

    It may seem like a gigantic copyright mess to license the transpiled files
    under the terms of all three licenses, however this is done to best avoid
    potential violations of the terms of ANY of the licenses above. Since
    Wikipedia requires text content to be released under CC BY-SA 3.0 and the
    GFDL, RedWarn's transpiled output files may not be published unless released
    under the terms of those licenses. Wikipedia requires this double-license
    format since 2009, and is a way to allow text to be used in a
    less-restrictive manner since the GFDL is too restrictive with text content.

    Since RedWarn consists of code and not documentation, it's best to license
    it under a code-focused license such as the Apache License 2.0. The Apache
    License allows for sublicensing, which can allow us to release the code as
    both under the Apache license and the GFDL and CC BY-SA 3.0 tandem that
    Wikipedia uses.

SUMMARY

    In summary, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS REPOSITORY MUST BE LICENSED UNDER
    THE Apache License 2.0. Transpiled versions of the code available on
    Wikimedia Foundation wikis are also licensed under the GFDL and CC BY-SA 3.0
    licenses.

    This will provide RedWarn with enough protection as an open-source code
    project while still allowing anyone to contribute, modify, redistribute,
    and republish the code.

    You are allowed to take the Wikipedia versions of the userscript (which
    are multi-licensed under all three aforementioned licenses) and use it
    with any CC BY-SA 3.0-compatible wiki.

DISCLAIMER

    RedWarn, as determined by its licenses, is provided on an "as is" basis
    without any warranties or conditions of any kind.

    This notice was put into place on September 12, 2021 (UTC). Code released
    under earlier versions may have only been released under the Apache License.
    Verify the time and date of involved commits prior to usage.
