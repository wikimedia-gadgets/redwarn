# redwarn-web (Development Branch)

RedWarn's userscript - made with TypeScript, Webpack, and TSX-DOM.

The [**R**ecent **Ed**its Patrol and **Warn**ing Tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RedWarn) (abbreviated as RedWarn) is a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/) [patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:RCP) and [counter-vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VD) tool, designed to be a user-friendly way to perform common moderation tasks.

You can help! If you find any bugs or would like new features, you can fix these or add them yourself. More technical documentation is coming in the user guide soon to help ease this process.
